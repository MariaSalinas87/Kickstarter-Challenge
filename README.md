# Kickstarter-Challenge
#### Different campaigns fared in relation between launch dates and their funding goals. 

The purpose of this research is for Ms. Louise to see how long it takes different kickstarters to reach their funding goals compared to their launch dates.
In order to find our answer, we needed to analyze the data. We had to compare different information. We had two different studies: Outcomes Based on Goal and Outcomes based on Launch Dates. 

The graph below shows us how many successful campaigns were based on the month they were launched, divied into three sections: canceled, failed and successful. I used the years and count of outcome. Later then the years were filtered into months of the year.

The graph below compares the outcome based on goal in percentage format. We filter the dollar amounts pledged on the campaign. These dollar amounts are divided into 12 different amount as followed: Less than $1000, $1000-$4999, $5000  to $9999,$10000 to $14999, $15000 to $19999, $20000 to $24999, $25000 to $29999, $30000 to $34999, $35000 to $39999, $40000 to $44999, $45000 to $49999, and $50000 or more.

According to our filtered data, we can see that the most successful month to launch a campaign was May reachin over 100 outcomes. Another conclusion we can see with our date about the **Theater Outcome Based on Launch Date** is that, is that there were not many canceled campaigns. 

When we look at our chart **Outcome based on Goal**, we notice that the lowest amount the goal was, the easier it was to reach goal. Campaigns under $1000 were reached at 100%,and as amounts were raised percentage reached dropped, with the lowest goal met of 20% happened at $25000 to $30000. Then we noticed goals met started rising again until the they reached the $45000 to $49999 mark, where none of the goal was met. 

In this specific scenerio we are only accessing two information graphs which relate to time and percentages of goals met. To get a better idea of success of the campaigns launched I would recommend adding a chart that compared the amount of the goal and the time it reached. This may help us determine what are more realistic goals for the time frame given.
